# JavaScript User Authentication Exercise

This repository contains a simple exercise demonstrating the integration of JavaScript into an HTML page to create a basic user authentication system. The goal is to showcase how to use built-in functions with HTML events to enhance interactivity in a website or web application.

## Exercise Description

The JavaScript programming language is used to enhance websites and web applications, making user interaction more dynamic. In this exercise, we will create an HTML page with input fields for a username and password. JavaScript will be utilized to compare the entered username and password, and if they are different, an error message will be displayed in a chosen HTML element on the page.

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Features

- The `index.html` page contains a form with input fields for a username and password.
- JavaScript is used to handle the form submission event.
- When the form is submitted, a JavaScript function is triggered to compare the entered username and password.
- If the username is the same as the password, an error message is displayed on the page using a designated HTML element.
- The style of the error message can be customized using CSS, which can be defined in the page header or in a separate stylesheet file.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Enter a username and a password in the respective fields.
3. Submit the form.
4. If the username is the same as the password, an error message will be displayed on the page.

## Customization

You can customize this exercise in various ways, including:

- **Visual Styling**: Add CSS styles to make the page more visually appealing.
- **Different Messages**: Modify the displayed messages based on different authentication conditions.
- **Validation Methods**: Explore other authentication methods, such as email-based authentication or two-factor authentication.

Feel free to explore, experiment, and learn more about integrating JavaScript into HTML pages!

**Note**: This is a basic exercise and should not be used as a secure authentication system in real-world applications. Secure authentication requires more advanced and robust practices.
